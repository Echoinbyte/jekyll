I’m a 16-year-old developer from Nepal passionate about building tools for creators, learners, and developers.

I've been developing with:

- ⚛ React, Next.js, TypeScript
- 🌐 Supabase, MongoDB, Node.js
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- 🧠 and a strong curiosity for solving problems

### My Journey

Started coding at 15, released multiple projects within a year, and currently building **Neploom**, a universe-themed blogging and learning platform.

I love creating intuitive UIs, solving backend challenges, and building communities around knowledge.
